/**
 * Hooks app.
 *
 * The hooks API consists primarily of actions, events, reactors, args, and
 * other extensions. Events are "fired" at various reactors when actions occur.
 * The args that the event relates to is passed to any extensions, along with
 * the list of predefined reactions. The extensions can then analyse the args and
 * the reaction specifications to determine whether the reactor should "hit" or
 * "miss" the target entity.

	/**
	 * Sets whether network-wide mode is on.
	 *
	 * This function should not be used, especially to turn network mode off when
	 * WordPoints has turned it on. I won't even say, "Unless you really know what
	 * you're doing," because trust me, if you're trying to do that, you don't. Here
	 * be dragons!
	 *
	 * For those of you that are specifically looking for something to break, here is
	 * how to do it.
	 *
	 * What network mode does is tell the hooks API that it is in the context of the
	 * network itself, and not of any particular site. This feature is what allows us
	 * to have network-wide reactions in addition to the standard, per-site
	 * reactions. When network mode is on, it means that we don't want to do anything
	 * with standard reactions at all, because even though there may be a "current
	 * site" that we could pull them from, we're actually supposed to be pretending
	 * that we aren't on a particular site on the network, but in network-wide
	 * context. So when network mode is turned on, you won't be able to do anything
	 * with standard reactions, only network-wide ones.
	 *
	 * This is why turning it off is so dangerousâ€”it would allow you to accidentally
	 * do things with standard reactions when you probably aren't expected to. The
	 * user is in the context of the network, for example in the network admin, so
	 * they're only expecting network-wide reactions to be affected. If you did
	 * something with standard reactions, you'd end up affecting a particular site,
	 * when the user doesn't think he is.
	 *
	 * @since 1.0.0
	 *
	 * @internal
	 *
	 * @param bool $on Whether network-wide mode should be on (or off).
